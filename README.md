You can [preview the completed app here](https://catstronauts-react.netlify.app/).

You can [find the server counterpart here](https://github.com/DevashishSuthar/Catstronauts-Backend).

## How to use this repo

This repo is the starting point of our React client application.

To get started:

1. Run `npm install`.
1. Run `npm start`.

This will start the React application and open up `localhost:3000` in your web browser.

> Note that the client will show an `ERROR: Failed to fetch` message unless you have the [counterpart GraphQL server](https://github.com/DevashishSuthar/Catstronauts-Backend) running locally on `localhost:4000`.
